We can prevent thread execution by using following methods:
1. yield()
2. join()
3. sleep()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yield()

1. yield method causes to pause current executing thread to give the chance for
waiting thread of same priority or high priority. If there is no waiting thread
or all waiting thread have low priority then same thread can continue its
execution

2. If multiple threads are waiting with the same priority then which waiting
thread will get the chance. we can't except as it depends on thread schedular.

3. The thread which is yielded, when it will get the chance one again it depends
on thread schedular and we can expect it execution agin.

4. Long running threads require yield method.

public static native void yield();
-----------------------------------------------
New/Born[MyThread t = new MyThread();
            |
            |  t.start();
            |
        Ready/Runnable  <-------------
            |                        |
            |  If thread schedular   |Thread.yield();
            |   allocates processor  |
          Running -------------------
            |
            |If run method completes
            |
           Dead
-----------------------------------------------

class MyThread extends Thread{
   public void run(){
        // Job of Thread
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
             sop("Child ThreadDemo")
             Thread.yield(); ----> Line 1
         }
    }
  }


class ThreadYieldDemo{

      //Main thread create and start child thread.
      psvm(){
        MyThread t = new MyThread();//creating thread instance
        t.start(); //starting thread
        for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
            sop("Main Thread")
        }
      }
}

In the above program if we comment line 1 both the thread will execute
simultaneously. We can't expect execution order. But if we don't comment line 1
then main thread will get processor more time than MyThread. As after every
execution MyThread calls Thread.yield() which check if other thread with same
priority is waiting or not.

Some platform won't provide proper support for yield method.
