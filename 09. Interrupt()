Interrupt Method

A thread can Interrupt **sleeping or waiting** thread by using interrupt()
of thread class.


A thread can be in waiting or sleeping state due to sleep() or join() method.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 1: Interrupt call

class MyThread extends Thread{
    public void run(){
      // Job of Thread
      for(int i=0;i<10;i++){
           try{
              sop("I am lazy thread");
              Thread.sleep(2000);
           }catch (InterruptedException e){
              sop("I am got Interrupted");
           }
      }
    }
}

class ThreadDemo{

    psvm() throws InterruptedException{
      MyThread t = new MyThread();//creating thread instance
      t.start();
      t.interrupt();   ------------> Line 1
      sop("End of Main Thread");
    }
  }
}


Output:
End of Main Thread
I am lazy thread
I am got Interrupted

If we comment line 1 the main thread won't interrupt child thread. child thread
will executed 10 time.

If we comment don't line 1 the main thread interrupt child thread. Output is you
can see in above example.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case 2: Interrupt call in the end of run method execution of child Thread

class MyThread extends Thread{
    public void run(){
      // Job of Thread
      for(int i=0;i<1000;i++)
        sop("MyThread: "i)

           try{
              sop("I am lazy thread");
              Thread.sleep(2000);
           }catch (InterruptedException e){
              sop("I am got Interrupted");
           }

    }
}

class ThreadDemo{

    psvm() throws InterruptedException{
      MyThread t = new MyThread();//creating thread instance
      t.start();
      t.interrupt();   ------------> Line 1
      sop("End of Main Thread");
    }
  }
}

Output:
MyThread: 1
MyThread: 2
End of Main Thread
MyThread: 3
MyThread: 4
  ""
  ""
MyThread: 1000
I am lazy thread
I am got Interrupted


In the above example interrupted call waited until child thread executed for loop
1000 time.

Note:
- Whenever we are calling interrupt method and if the target thread is not in
sleeping or waiting then there is no impact call interrupt call immediately.
- Interrupt thread will impact immediately target thread if target thread
enter in to sleeping or waiting state.
- If the never enter in to waiting or sleeping state in its lifecycle the
interrupt call will be wasted.
